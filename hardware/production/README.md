# Production Profile

- Goal: final hardware set with rotary encoder, full button set, battery/power, enclosure mounts, and optional I2S audio.
- BOM: ESP32-WROVER module/dev board, ST7789 display, rotary encoder (EC11), tactile buttons, MicroSD SPI, LiPo (1000–2000 mAh), TP4056 (USB-C), optional I2S DAC/amp.
- Power: battery + charging/regulation; plan switch and battery sensing.
- PCB: to be captured under `hardware/pcb/` when ready.
- Enclosure: note mounting points and connector cutouts.
- Notes: define final GPIO map, connector types, and cable lengths.***
